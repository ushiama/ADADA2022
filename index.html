                        Art Papers are more artistically-oriented papers than Technical Papers. You can present any type of artwork, as long as digital technologies are used in it. If you produced a cutting-edge digital art such as a computer animation and an interactive art,
                        Art Papers would be a great showcase at an oral presentation. You can share your ideas between hundreds of artists and researchers, and it may evoke a synergistic effect in the Asian digital art community. You should describe an
                        artistic motivation, a background of your artwork, and how digital technologies are involved in your work, and so on.
